# Twilio Superclass

A resource for Twilio Superclass workshops 🎉😄

## 🤔 What is a Twilio "Superclass"?

Superclass is self-directed training for developers who want to level up their Twilio skills.

On-site mentors will guide you through a self-paced, choose-your-own-adventure coding experience that’s built on Twilio’s education platform: [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest).
